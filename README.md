# Predicted prevalence calculations

Code for calculating predicted prevalence, with age/sex adjustment, based on national averages.

Health Survey for England data from 2022 is used for national estimates: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2022-part-2#data-sets

These are applied to BSOL GP practice list sizes at the time of running, then compared with the reported % in the QOF prevalence to yield an 'under or over reported number'.
